# Build Journal

> **Role:** The dated record of how the build got here — one entry per completed feature.
> **Append after every completed feature**; **compact at every phase checkpoint.**
> **Do not read this file at session start.** Open it only to reconstruct one specific feature's history; the rules that still bind live in `constraints.md`.

## How this file is maintained

This file grows for the life of the project and is **not** part of the session
read order. Nothing here is required to make a decision — anything that still
constrains future work gets promoted to `constraints.md`, which is the file
consulted during ordinary work. That separation is what keeps the cost of
knowing "what binds" from growing with the length of the build.

- **Append a dated entry after every completed feature**, under the current phase: decisions made, gotchas hit, verification results.
- **Compact at every phase checkpoint, never continuously.** When a phase closes:
  1. **Promote** anything from that phase that still binds into `constraints.md`, filed under its topic.
  2. **Collapse** the phase's per-feature entries into a handful of summary bullets.
  3. **Drop every `Verified:` line** — it has done its job once the next feature passes.
- Only the current phase keeps full per-feature detail. Earlier phases stay compacted, newest first.

Compaction is recoverable: this file is committed, so `git` history holds every
detail ever removed. Compact confidently.

<!-- Newest phase first. Entry format — repeat per completed feature:

## Phase {{N}} — {{PHASE_NAME}}

### Feature {{NN}} — {{FEATURE_NAME}}  *(YYYY-MM-DD)*
- Decision: …
- Gotcha: …
- Verified: …

At that phase's checkpoint, the whole phase collapses to:

## Phase {{N}} — {{PHASE_NAME}} *(compacted)*
- {{SUMMARY_BULLET}} (F{{NN}}–F{{NN}})

## Phase 0 — Foundation *(compacted 2026-08-12)*

- **The stack pinned itself lower than planned, twice, and both times measurement decided it.** `architecture.md` named TypeScript 7; `typescript-eslint` refuses it at runtime and takes all of `eslint-config-next` down with it, so the project runs TS 6. ESLint pinned to 9 for an unrelated reason — `eslint-plugin-react` calls the pre-10 rule context API. Three workarounds were tested and rejected before deciding. (F01)
- **Environment split into public and secret modules.** The single Zod schema the docs described would have thrown on the first browser import of the Supabase client, because Next replaces non-public `process.env` reads with `undefined` client-side. `env.ts` holds `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, `env.server.ts` holds secrets behind `server-only`. (F01)
- **Quality gates are adversarial by construction.** Every gate was proven able to fail before being trusted: a deliberate `any` fails lint, a drifted token fails `_verify.mjs` by name, a Client Component importing `env.server.ts` fails the build, and moving the Tailwind import below `:root` fails the cascade check. (F01–F02)
- **The token mirror is guarded in three places.** The kit, the copy in `library-docs.md`, and `globals.css` must all agree — the stylesheet that actually renders was previously the one copy nothing checked. That third copy also proved to be recoverable source: an uncommitted `globals.css` was destroyed twice by `git checkout --` and restored from it both times. (F02)
- **Five kit token families collide with Tailwind's theme namespaces** (`radius`, `text`, `leading`, `tracking`, `ease`). Tailwind emits a self-referential declaration for each; they resolve only because `:root` cascades after the import. Both naming strategies were compiled and compared before committing to this one. (F02)
- **The wordmark went to PascalCase with both i's dotted**, at the owner's direction, and a real alignment bug surfaced doing it: the square was centred on the glyph's advance box rather than on the letter, 3.08px off at hero size. Corrected from measured font metrics, in three independent copies that each carried the same error. (F02)
- **Home's visual surface landed early**, following `ui_kits/site/` for layout, with its controls inert until F05/F06 wire them — the Core Principle's build-the-surface-first, made explicit in `build-plan.md` so the plan does not claim finished work. (F02)
- **The database was verified by impersonation, not by inspection.** Advisors returned zero security findings, but only seeded users queried under `set local role authenticated` proved the co-participant policy does not recurse and that one user cannot see another's meetings. That exercise also found a redundant policy, a wrong `EXECUTE` revoke, and an example room code the schema rejects. (F03)
- **Two migrations exist only because verification failed.** Revoking `EXECUTE` on the RLS helper breaks every read; the two participation policies were nested rather than complementary. Both corrections are their own migrations so a replay from scratch ends where the live database is. (F03)
- **Documentation was wrong in ways only execution caught**: an example room code the alphabet forbids, and a self-contradicting expiry sweep. Neither would have been found by review. (F03)
